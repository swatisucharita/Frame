This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* This acts as a container for rendering multiple micro frontends.
* Run the individual micro front end servers and add the server url in the .env file.
* Change the App.js file to add the micro front end sections and pass the server info to the MicroFrontend component.
* Make sure to follow the naming conventions.
